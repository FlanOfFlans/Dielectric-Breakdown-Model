Implements a dielectric breakdown model as initially layed out by L. Niemeyer, L. Pietronero, and H.J. Wiesmann in Fractal Dimension of Dielectric Breakdown in Godot 4.3, to generate Lichtenberg fractals.

Ionized cells and electrodes are marked in black. Colors indicate relative electric potential, with blue as 1.0 and red as 0.0. Once initiated, generation continues until the fractal connects with the outer electrode.

By the nature of the simulation in question, this can get quite slow at high resolutions and solve step counts!
